## What is Web Application Pentesting?

Web application penetration testing is a **comprehensive security assessment** aimed at identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a web application.

It involves **simulating real-world attacks** to evaluate the application's security posture and provide **recommendations for remediation**.

## Why Use a Methodology?

Using a proper **methodology** is vital because it ensures:

- A **structured, repeatable, and systematic** testing approach
- Coverage of all critical areas
- Ethical and lawful conduct, with proper authorization

## Importance of Following a Methodology

- **Industry Standards**: Most methodologies are based on **OWASP**, **NIST**, **PTES**, etc.
- **Detection of Complex Vulnerabilities**: Advanced flaws often need a structured approach to identify.
- **Ethical Testing**: Ensures adherence to scope and authorization (rules of engagement).
- **Improved Communication**: Methodology leads to consistent and standardized reporting.

## What is Ad-Hoc Testing?

**Ad-hoc testing** refers to an **unstructured, informal** way of testing without a plan or documentation.

**Limitation**: Vulnerabilities may be missed, and results can‚Äôt be reproduced or verified easily.

**Structured testing** using a methodology is more reliable and thorough.

## What is Web Application Testing Methodology?

A web application testing methodology is a **step-by-step guide** followed during a pentest to:

- Identify vulnerabilities
- Evaluate application logic
- Provide remediation guidance

## How to Add Sites to Scope in OWASP ZAP

### Step 1: **Launch ZAP**

- Open ZAP and start a new session (save if needed).

### Step 2: **Access the Website**

- Either:
  - Manually browse your site through ZAP‚Äôs **built-in browser**, OR
  - Use ZAP as a proxy in your system/browser (configure browser proxy settings to `127.0.0.1:8080`)

### Step 3: **Include Site in Scope**

1. In the **Sites** tab (left panel), right-click the domain (e.g., `http://example.com`)
2. Select ‚Üí `Include in Context` ‚Üí `Default Context` or create a new one

### Step 4: **View and Modify Context**

1. Go to `Tools` ‚Üí `Options` ‚Üí `Contexts`
2. Select your context (e.g., Default Context)
3. Define:
   - **Included/Excluded URLs**
   - **Authentication/Session Management**
   - **User configuration**
   - **Technology stack**

### Step 5: **Start Scanning**

- Use **Spider**, **Active Scan**, or **Fuzzing** tools after the site is in context/scope

### Best Practices When Using ZAP

- Always use in **authorized environments** (test/staging or whitelisted production)
- Avoid scanning **out-of-scope endpoints** to prevent legal or functional issues
- Review **scan policies** to limit payloads in production environments
- Combine **ZAP passive scan + manual exploration** for better coverage

# Website Recon & Footprinting

Website reconnaissance and footprinting are the **first steps in web application penetration testing**. These steps focus on **gathering publicly available information** (OSINT) about the target before launching any active attack.

## Goals of Reconnaissance

The aim is to **build a detailed profile** of the target application and infrastructure.

### What Are We Looking For?

| Information Type                              | Example / Purpose                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ **IP Address**                             | Understand where the server is hosted           |
| ‚úÖ **Directories Hidden from Search Engines** | Using tools or via `/robots.txt`                |
| ‚úÖ **Subdomains**                             | May reveal admin panels, dev sites, etc.        |
| ‚úÖ **Emails**                                 | Can be used for phishing or credential stuffing |
| ‚úÖ **Phone Numbers**                          | Targeted attacks or social engineering          |
| ‚úÖ **Physical Address**                       | Often found in About Us or Contact pages        |
| ‚úÖ **Web Technologies Used**                  | Web server, framework, CMS, DB, JS libraries    |

## Key Files to Check

### üìÑ `/robots.txt`

- Used to instruct search engines which pages to ignore.
- Can unintentionally **reveal hidden or sensitive paths**.

## Summary Table of Tools

| Tool         | Purpose                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| EyeWitness   | Capture screenshots of websites            |
| whatweb      | Identify technologies used on target       |
| HTTrack      | Download full website for offline review   |
| theHarvester | Collect emails, subdomains, IPs from OSINT |
| robots.txt   | Check for disallowed (hidden) directories  |
| sitemap.xml  | Discover indexed but unlinked pages        |

Leaked password Databases

haveibeenpwned.com

if we were targettng an organisation we got the email address using thiss sites if we get password we can spray password

is haveibeenpwned the only site ? no but its free

how do i get the paaswords if they are part of breach ?

Passive web app fingerprinting

using tools lile browser extension like wappilizer builtwith , cli like whatweb

Googel Dorks

It is also known as google hacking by hackers/pentester

using google search filters to know how to find exactly what we are looking for

like using site:

inurl:

what if we want to enumerate subdomains via google ?

we can do that searching site:\*.ine.com

intitle:

filetype:

if we are looking at sites with directory list enabled we can use the title search filter and specify that within the title index of

title: index of

this is a common vulnerability with in our web servers

waybackmachine essentially stores the older snapshots of the websites

inurl:auth_user_file.txt

Google hacking database which is owned by offsec the parent company which maintains and develops kali linux

Copy /Download a website using the tool HttRack for analysis

we can the httrack by the command httrack

if we want to copy a site first we need to copy that site for that create a folder for that site

navigate into that dir

httrack [www.zonetransfer.me](http://www.zonetransfer.me) -O zonetranfer/

in this it will not be successfull one because there is redirects present to handle this case what we can do is to specify depth

(write down the steps using wizard )

Here‚Äôs your **corrected, organized, and easy-to-understand** note on:

1. **Leaked Password Databases**
2. **Passive Web Application Fingerprinting**
3. **Google Dorks**
4. **Wayback Machine**
5. **Using HTTrack with Wizard**

This is beginner-friendly, pentester-relevant, and well-structured for your study notes or future reference.

Why might someone prefer using the command line interface of HT Track over the graphical user interface?

It provides more control and flexibility

# üîì Leaked Password Databases

## ‚úÖ What is a Leaked Password Database?

These are **collections of usernames/emails and passwords** that have been exposed in **data breaches** and are often sold or published online.

---

### üîç Popular Site: [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

- Free tool to check if an **email** or **password** has been involved in a known data breach.
- If you're targeting an organization and have harvested email addresses, you can:
  - Check if any email was compromised
  - Use discovered passwords for **password spraying or credential stuffing**

> ‚ùó Spray attacks: Using a few known passwords (e.g., ‚ÄúWelcome@123‚Äù) across many users to avoid lockouts.

---

### ‚ùì Is HaveIBeenPwned the Only Site?

No. Here are a few alternatives:

| Platform                | Description                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dehashed**            | Paid and free service to search leaked databases   |
| **BreachDirectory.org** | Search breached credentials                        |
| **IntelX.io**           | Powerful OSINT tool (freemium)                     |
| **Snusbase.com**        | Commercial access to breached data                 |
| **Scylla.sh**           | API-based breach data search (free tier available) |

---

### üí° How Do You Get the Password?

- If it‚Äôs public (e.g., from a pastebin dump), you can access it directly.
- For private datasets, access might require:
  - OSINT tools (e.g., Dehashed with account)
  - Data leak forums or marketplaces (‚ö†Ô∏è legal risk!)
  - **Use responsibly and ethically with authorization!**
